# electron-webpack-obfuscation

A barebones boilerplate to get webpack & babel working with electron.

### Usage

I reccomend using this with VSCode, and installing the ESLint & Prettier extensions for VSCode. They will enable a clean code style for you and help you maintain your code quickly and easily.
